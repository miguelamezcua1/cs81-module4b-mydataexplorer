## Reflection: My Data Journal

### Were your predictions right?
Some of my predictions were right, like guessing that Wednesday had the most screen time. I also thought Thursday would be my best focus day, and the results agreed. But I was surprised that caffeine didn’t really improve focus — the days with less caffeine had better focus scores.

### What surprised you?
I didn’t expect that relaxed days like Saturday and Sunday had good focus even with no caffeine. It made me think maybe sleep and stress matter more than coffee.

### What was tricky or rewarding?
The hardest part was writing the mood-counting function. I wasn’t sure how to use an object to count things at first, but after testing it a few times I got it to work. The most rewarding part was seeing the final results print out — it felt cool to analyze real data that came from my own life.

### How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data made it more interesting and personal. I actually cared about what the results would show, and it helped me understand functions and loops better because I could picture what each day really looked like.
